Problem:

1. I hav only 1 html file in react, so I have only one route.
2. We cant add mulltiple html files in react// single page application
3. to fix this issue , react have library
    - react-router-dom


Question - How to use react-router dom

1. installation: npm i react-router-dom@6
2. Wrap out application in BrowserRouter- index.js
    - import {BrowserRouter} from "react-route-dom";
    - wrap <BrowserRouter> <App/> </BrowserRouter>

3. Create Routes
    / : home
    /about : About
    /products : Products


4. use Link tag instead of anchor tag
